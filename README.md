# Brain Tumor Classification using CNN

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based solution for classifying brain tumors from MRI images. The model is capable of distinguishing between four different categories:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

## ðŸ§  Dataset

The dataset used for training the model can be downloaded from Kaggle:

ðŸ‘‰ [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Streamlit App

1. Make sure all the required libraries are installed and dataset also installed

use this comand
 
 `
 pip install streamlit tensorflow pillow matplotlib numpy

 `
2. then open the brain_cancer_classfication_using_cnn.ipynb 
3. run the file then you get best_model.h5 file
4. Open your terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory containing the `stream_tumor.py` file.
6. Run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run stream_tumor.py
```
